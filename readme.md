## üöÄ Getting Started

### Managing the Product List

The most important part of managing this website is the **`products.csv`** file.

- **To Add, Remove, or Edit Products:** Simply open the `products.csv` file in any spreadsheet program (like Excel or Google Sheets) or a text editor.
- **Required Columns:** The file must contain the following columns: `id`, `name`, `category`, `price`, `originalPrice`.
- After saving your changes to `products.csv`, commit and push the file to GitHub. Vercel will automatically redeploy the site with the updated inventory.

### Running Locally

Due to browser security policies (CORS), you cannot run this project by simply opening the `index.html` file. You must use a local server.

1.  **Using VS Code Live Server (Recommended):**
    - Install the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code.
    - Open the project folder and click the "Go Live" button in the bottom-right corner.

2.  **Using Python:**
    - Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
    - Run the command: `python -m http.server`
    - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Deployment

This project is optimized for deployment on **Vercel**.

1.  Push the entire project repository to GitHub.
2.  Sign up for a Vercel account and connect it to your GitHub.
3.  Import the GitHub repository into Vercel.
4.  Vercel will automatically detect the settings and deploy. No configuration is needed.

Future pushes to the `main` branch on GitHub will trigger automatic redeployments on Vercel.
